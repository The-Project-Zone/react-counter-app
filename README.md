### About
The React Counter App was built to understand how redux gets integrated into various portions of an application along with some slightly complex updates to state. Another similar application [Simple Counter](https://simplecounter.app/) was the source of inspiration for this application. It was a really good experience to understand how well we would need to think about architecting an application even if something seems very simple at the surface level.

### Built Using
- React JS
- Create React App
- React Redux and Redux Toolkit
- React Hooks
- Bootstrap / Sass
